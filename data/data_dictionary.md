## Technical Implementation

### Recommended Database Indexes

For optimal query performance, create these indexes:

```sql
-- Primary index on churn status (most frequent filter)
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Churn_Status 
ON [MTN Nigeria Customer Churn$] ([Customer Churn Status])
INCLUDE ([Total Revenue], [Satisfaction Rate], [Customer Tenure in months]);

-- Geographic analysis index
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_State 
ON [MTN Nigeria Customer Churn$] (State)
INCLUDE ([Customer Churn Status], Age, Gender);

-- Demographic segmentation index
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Age 
ON [MTN Nigeria Customer Churn$] (Age)
INCLUDE ([Customer Churn Status], Gender);

-- Product performance index
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Subscription_Plan 
ON [MTN Nigeria Customer Churn$] ([Subscription Plan])
INCLUDE ([Customer Churn Status], [MTN Device], [Total Revenue]);

-- Lifecycle analysis index
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Tenure 
ON [MTN Nigeria Customer Churn$] ([Customer Tenure in months])
INCLUDE ([Customer Churn Status], [Satisfaction Rate]);

-- Satisfaction correlation index
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Satisfaction_Churn 
ON [MTN Nigeria Customer Churn$] ([Satisfaction Rate], [Customer Churn Status]);
```

### Query Performance Considerations

**Optimized Query Patterns:**
- State-based queries benefit from `IX_State` index
- Churn analysis queries leverage `IX_Churn_Status`
- Demographic segmentation uses `IX_Age` and included columns
- Product analysis optimized with `IX_Subscription_Plan`
- Lifecycle queries benefit from `IX_Tenure`

**Performance Tips:**
- Use WHERE clauses on indexed columns
- Leverage covering indexes (INCLUDE clause)
- Apply appropriate JOIN strategies
- Consider query execution plans for complex queries
- Use aggregations efficiently with GROUP BY
